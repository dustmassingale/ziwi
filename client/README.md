This folder contains two options to run your front-end:

### `./angular`

An Angular 6 single page application (SPA),
created with Angular CLI 6.0.3, `ng init ziwi --style=css --routing=true`.

### `./react`

A React 16 single page application (SPA),
created with Create React App 3.0.1, `npx create-react-app ziwi`.

----

Both clients depend on a back-end API like `server/node.js-express`, or
alternatively, you can run a combined back-end and front-end with
`server/asp.net-core`.
