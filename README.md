# Ziwi

With Gitpod, this repo provides a ready-to-code dev environment having Node.js,
.NET Core, PostgreSQL, an HTTP server, and more. It also includes a simple,
full-stack web application to explore these technologies.

Ziwi is focused on getting you a complete full-stack starter project that's
ready for hacking in just a few clicks. The app itself should be well
documented and simple to understand for moderately experienced devs. If you
have questions, please contact

Happy hacking!
